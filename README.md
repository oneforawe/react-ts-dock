# React-TS-Dock

This repository is [or rather, will be] a template for Dockerized React app
projects written in TypeScript and based on the old create-react-app "CRA"
infrastructure (so without a meta-framework like Next.js).

See the [creation notes](./doc/Creation.md) for details on how this repo was
created and how to re-create it.
